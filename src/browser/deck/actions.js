  // or anything compatible like a Cursor to an Immutable.List.

  //
  // Structure is used to represent collection of items where single item
  // from it could be **selected** and / or **active**. In most cases same
  // item will be both **selected** and **active**, although there may
  // be transitive `deq` states where item **active** will be different
  // from **selected** item. Such state represents state of while switching
  // **active** item from currently **active** to currently **selected**.
  // To picture this think of the app switcher UI, quick hits on `cmd tab`
  // (without releasing keys quickly) selects different application but
  // only releasing keys activates selected application.
  //
  // Items inserted will always be append to the tail of the actual data
  // structure. Sorting is supported through `weight` proprty that is
  // assigned & managed by below transformation fucntions.
